# SchereSteinPapier
This Project is made by Julian, Maximilian and Sena.
This basic Rock-Paper-Scissors game was done with JavaFX.

Each branch contains different parts of the work, but the entire process is step by step in the master branch (including all commits and merges).

The finished version of the project is available in master and main, but main only contains the final version without the steps.
